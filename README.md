Unit 4 homework Code Quiz

This is my coding quiz. A player will start the game and have a time limit to answer a series of coding questions. If they make wrong choice when answering questions they will recieve a time penalty. When they complete all questions or time runs out they will be taken to a "highscores" page where they can view a list of the highest scores.
